# Not decoration, and not "the rest of the repository" either -- each of these
# is something the suite reads at runtime, and the image collected nothing at
# all without them:
#   allure/     the failure grouping that `tests/conftest.py` copies into every
#               results directory; without it a containerised run produces a
#               report with an empty Categories tab.
#   showcase/   imported by `tests/unit/test_showcase_build.py` and
#               `test_showcase_merge.py`, and read by `test_showcase_figures.py`
#               (the diagrams and the cover template it checks the numbers in).
#   scripts/    read by `tests/unit/test_publish_showcase_script.py`.
#   stand/      imported by tests/stand and by the local_stand fixture;
#               pytest collects tests/stand before -m selects anything.
#   .github/    tests/unit/test_ci_targets.py reads ci.yml straight off disk
#               to check the pipeline's own shape.
#   Makefile    read by tests/unit/test_setup_instructions.py, which holds the
#               README's install line to the one `make install` runs.
#   the report screenshot
#               measured by tests/unit/test_readme_images.py: every picture the
#               README shows has to exist and be the size its exporter writes,
#               and this is the only one of them outside showcase/.
# pytest collects the whole `tests/` tree before it applies `-m`, so a missing
# import in `tests/unit` aborted the session before a single API test ran --
# `-m api` inside the container failed on a file that has nothing to do with
# the API. Found by running it, not by reading it.

# The API layer by default: it is the one layer that needs no browser, no
# display and no probe of somebody else's site, so `docker compose run --rm
# tests` works everywhere. The browser layers are one argument away and the
# README says so.
