"""Every dependency list this repository states twice states the same thing.

The Setup block in the README is the first command anybody runs here, and it
was installing `.[dev]` while the suite could not so much as collect without
`.[stand]`: `tests/stand/conftest.py` imports `fastapi.testclient`,
`tests/stand/test_pages_contract.py` imports `selectolax`, and the
`local_stand` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` imports uvicorn and
`stand.app.main`. A first run that ends in a collection error is a first
impression nobody recovers from, so the extras a reader is told to install are
pinned against the extras `make install` uses -- the one install line in this
repository that is executed rather than read.

Superset rather than equality on purpose. The Makefile is what CI and the
maintainer run, so it is the floor; a README that told a reader to install
*more* than that (a future `docs` extra, say) is generous, not wrong. Less is
the failure this pin exists for.
